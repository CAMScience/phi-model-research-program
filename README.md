# Φ-Model Research Program

*A unified framework connecting finite-resolution physics, non-commutative geometry, and Loop Quantum Gravity*

---

## 📖 Overview

This repository contains the complete collection of research papers and computational tools developing the **Φ-Model** framework - a comprehensive approach to quantum geometry that bridges measurement theory, non-commutative mathematics, and quantum gravity.

The core insight: *spacetime continuum emerges from finite measurement resolution*, formalized through the fundamental non-commutativity:
`[P_ℓ, lim] = δ_ℓ ≠ 0`

## 🎯 Research Trilogy

### **1. Foundations**
- **The Φ-Model**: Epistemic noncommutativity and finite-resolution physics
- **The Rational Circle**: Emergence of mathematical constants from resolution limits
- **Time as Projection**: Empirical tests and observational consequences

### **2. Theoretical Framework**  
- **Finite-Resolution Quantum Geometry**: Linking non-commutative projection with Loop Quantum Gravity
- **The Emergent Geometry Conjecture**: Research program for classical spacetime from quantum algebras

### **3. Computational Verification**
- **Numerical Implementation**: Computational verification of the Δₗ framework
- **Development of Computational Tools**: Numerical predictions and validation

## 🚀 Key Features

- **Unified Variational Functional**: `S_ℓ[j,ι]` incorporating LQG operators with resolution corrections
- **Three Formulations of Δₗ**: Algebraic, information-theoretic, and geometric approaches
- **Complete Coefficient Calibration**: First-principles derivation of coupling constants
- **Renormalization Group Flow**: Dynamic resolution scale evolution
- **Testable Predictions**: Modified dispersion relations, LQC corrections, CMB signatures

## 🔬 Core Concepts

- **Finite-Resolution Physics**: Operational limits to geometric measurement
- **Non-Commutative Projection**: `[P_ℓ, lim] = δ_ℓ ≠ 0` as fundamental principle
- **Emergent Spacetime**: Classical geometry as resolution-limited approximation
- **Geometric Constants**: Mathematical ideals as infinite-resolution limits
